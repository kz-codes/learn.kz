# Hadoop vs. Spark

## Misconceptions

1. Hadoop is Database => but it is File System
2. Spark is 100 times dater than hadoop => **upto**
3. Spark process run on RAM but hadoop doesn't => both require ram but hadoop uses disk

## Differences

1. Perf
   - Hadoop uses File system as in disk.
   - Spark uses RAM
   - therefore the I/O is the bottleneck on the perf but not the processing
   - i.e if I/O is not involved then perf is not a huge difference
2. Batch/Steaming
   - Hadoop is built for batching
   - Spark can also do steaming
3. Ease of Use
   - Difficult to code in but **Hive** was built to make it easier
   - **Spark** is easy to write and debug, includes an interactive shell and low and high level APIs
4. Security
   - **Hadoop** uses Kerberos Auth using YARN and ACL auth with HDFS
   - **Spark** has no builtin security feature but can acces these features using HDFS and YARN
5. Fault Tolerance
   - **Hadoop** uses block of data and replication factor to handle the failure
   - **Spark** uses DAG
